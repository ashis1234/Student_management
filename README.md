My main project is Student Management System, basically, in this project, I kept four types of views.
1.> PrincipalView, the principal has been authorized to add a new department, session, and manage teacher.
2.> HODView, the hod can add new subject in their department for respective batch and assign teacher for that subjects also he can act as a teacher. And for every department, almost one hod is there.
3.> TeacherView, the teacher can take attendance of the students, and he is also able to see the attendance report of a particular student. He gives assignments to the respective departments and is also able to see the response of the students. Teachers can apply for leave to the principal and be able to see if their leave is approved or not.
4.> StudentView, the student is able to submit their assignment within the deadline for respective subjects and also able to apply for leave to respective HOD.
5.> Educational Post, any authorized user able to write a post and anyone can comment, like, dislike the post.
